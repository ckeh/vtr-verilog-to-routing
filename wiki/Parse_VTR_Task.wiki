#summary Manual page for parse_vtr_task.pl

= Overview =

This script is used to parse the output of one or more tasks.  The values that will be parsed are specified using a [ParseFiles Parse Configuration File], which is specified as part of the overall task configuration (See [CreatingTasks Creating and Modifying Tasks]).

The script will always parse the results of the latest execution of the task.

= Usage = 
The usage is:
<code>
`<vtr>`/vtr_flow/scripts/parse_vtr_task.pl <task_name1> <task_name2> ... [OPTIONS] 
</code>

=Options=
*`-l <task_list_file>`*: A file containing a list of tasks to parse.  Each task name should be on a separate line.


*Note*: At least one task must be specified, either directly as a parameter or through the `-l` option.

*`-create_golden`*: The results will be stored as golden results.  If previous golden results exist they will be overwritten.  The golden results are located here:
<code>
`<vtr>/vtr_flow/tasks/<task_name>/config/golden_results.txt`
</code>
*`-verify_golden`*: The results will be compared to the golden results.  


=Output=
This script produces no standard output.  A tab delimited file containing the parse results will be produced for each task.  The file will be located here:

<code>
`<vtr>/vtr_flow/tasks/<task_name>/run<#>/parse_results.txt`
</code>
